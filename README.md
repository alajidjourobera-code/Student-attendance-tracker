# Student Attendance Tracker

## Project Description
This project helps teachers take student attendance faster and easier using a computer or phone.  
Instead of calling names one by one, the teacher can mark attendance in the system.  
In the future, students will be able to sign in by scanning a QR code or using their phone.
